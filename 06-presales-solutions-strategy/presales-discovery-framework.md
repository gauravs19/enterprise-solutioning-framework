# Presales Solutions Strategy: Winning through Engineering Authority

**Context:** Presales is about building **Technical Trust**. A senior Solutions Architect in presales doesn't just "talk"; they provide a roadmap that addresses the client's deepest anxieties (Cost, Risk, Scale).

## 1. The "Discovery-First" Framework (Art of the Possible)
The goal is to move from a vendor to a **Trusted Advisor**.

### The 3-Step Discovery Process:
1.  **Business Mapping**: Identifying the "Pain Center" (e.g., "We are losing $1M/year due to bearing failure downtime").
2.  **Constraint Analysis**: Uncovering the "Hard Walls" (e.g., "We must use Azure," "Data cannot leave Germany").
3.  **The MVP (Minimum Viable Pilot)**: Defining the smallest unit of work that proves ROI.

## 2. Solution Estimations: The "Should-Cost" Model
Avoid "Guesstimations." Use a structured approach to technical costing.

### The "Bottom-Up" Estimation Pillar:
*   **Discovery & Design**: 15% of total effort.
*   **Implementation (Core)**: The bulk of the work.
*   **Stability & Hardening (NFRs)**: 20-30% (Often overlooked by junior architects).
*   **Contingency (Complexity Factor)**: Apply a multiplier (1.1x to 1.5x) based on the "Newness" of the tech stack.

## 3. The Solution Pitch: "Problem -> Pattern -> Proof"
When presenting to a CTO/Stakeholder, use this high-signal structure:

1.  **The Problem**: "You have 100K devices with disconnected data silos."
2.  **The Pattern**: "We will implement a **Decoupled IoT Topology** with an Ingestion Hub and Redis Streams for burst absorption."
3.  **The Proof**: "This pattern has been proven to handle 50k RPS in similar industrial contexts (referencing ESAF Technical Blueprints)."

## 4. Presales Artifact Checklist
What to leave behind after a meeting:
- [ ] **High-Level Solution (HLS) Diagram**: Single-page architecture overview.
- [ ] **Risk Matrix**: How we will handle the top 3 technical risks.
- [ ] **Capability Roadmap**: Phase 1 (MVP) -> Phase 2 (Scale) -> Phase 3 (Intelligence).
- [ ] **TCO Projection**: High-level estimate of run costs vs. build costs.
