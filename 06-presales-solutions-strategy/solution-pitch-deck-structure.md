**Focus:** Moving from "How it works" to "Why it matters."

## 1. The Executive Narrative Structure

### Part A: The Mirror (Empathy)
"We've heard that your biggest challenge today is [X], costing you [Y] in downtime/overhead."

### Part B: The Bridge (Vision)
"To solve this, we propose a shift to a [Decoupled/Reactive/AI-first] architecture that enables [Key Result]."

### Part C: The Engine (Technical Authority)
"Our ESAF-verified patterns (IoT Topology, Zero-Trust) ensure that this is built for 5-year stability, not just a 3-month pilot."

## 2. Handling Technical Objections
The "Feel-Felt-Found" Framework:
*   *"I understand you **feel** that Kafka is too complex for this project."*
*   *"Other clients have **felt** the same way initially."*
*   *"What they **found** was that the persistence guarantees of Kafka saved them $500k in data recovery costs during the first network outage."*

## 3. The Roadmap Pitch
**Phase 1: Foundation (3-4 Months)** - Core Ingestion, Initial Dashboards.
**Phase 2: Intelligence (6 Months)** - Anomaly Detection, AI Triage.
**Phase 3: Scale (Continuous)** - Multi-region rollout, Advanced Digital Twins.
