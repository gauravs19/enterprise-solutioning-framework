# Digital Transformation Maturity Model (DTMM)

**Purpose:** To provide a diagnostic tool for organizations to assess their current state and define a roadmap for architectural evolution.

## 1. The Five Levels of Maturity

| Level | State | Characteristics | Primary Architectural Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **L1** | **Reactive** | Siloed data, manual processes, legacy monoliths. | **Standardization**: Establish common platforms. |
| **L2** | **Integrated** | APIs connecting main systems, basic cloud adoption. | **Decoupling**: Move to event-driven architectures. |
| **L3** | **Scalable** | Cloud-native, microservices, CI/CD automation. | **Automation**: Full lifecycle DevOps. |
| **L4** | **Data-Driven** | Real-time analytics, Predictive IoT flow. | **Intelligence**: Injecting ML/AI into the core. |
| **L5** | **Agentic** | Autonomous self-healing systems, Agentic AI Orchestration. | **Autonomous Delivery**: Zero-touch operations. |

## 2. Assessment Dimensions

### A. Data & Intelligence
- How long does it take to move a data point from Edge to Dashboard?
- Are we using "Hindsight" (Reports) or "Foresight" (Predictive)?

### B. Engineering Culture
- Deployment Frequency: Monthly (L1) vs Daily (L4) vs On-Commit (L5).
- MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery): Measured in days vs minutes.

### C. Strategic Alignment
- Is IT seen as a "Cost Center" (L1) or a "Strategic Enabler" (L5)?
- How easily can the business pivot to a new product line?

## 3. The Gap Analysis Spreadsheet
*(Template logic included in this framework)*
1.  **Survey Stakeholders**: Across Business, Product, and Engineering.
2.  **Weighted Averaging**: Identify the "Weakest Pillar" (usually Governance or Talent).
3.  **Roadmap Generation**: Prioritizing "Low-Hanging Fruit" (Quick Wins) to fund the long-term shift.
