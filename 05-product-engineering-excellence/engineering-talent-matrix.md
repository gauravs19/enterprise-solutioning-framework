# The Product Engineering Talent Matrix

**Context:** Building a great product requires a specific mix of "Product Mindset" and "Engineering Rigor."

---

## 1. The "T-Shaped" Engineer Requirement

Product Engineers must have:
*   **Depth (Vertical)**: Mastery of the technical stack (e.g., Java/Spring, Reactive Patterns).
*   **Breadth (Horizontal)**: Understanding of the business domain, UX empathy, and an obsession with the "Why."

## 2. Squad Structure for Product Maturity

| Role | Responsibility | Maturity Signal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tech Lead** | Architectural integrity and Debt Governance. | Velocity vs. Stability balance. |
| **Product Engineer** | Feature delivery and Unit Resilience. | Zero-defect releases. |
| **Automation Architect** | Observability and CI/CD Quality Gates. | Deployment frequency. |
| **SRE / FinOps** | Production cost and uptime monitoring. | Cost-per-ingestion. |

## 3. Performance Metrics (Beyond LOC)
- **Impact Duration**: How long does it take for a code change to positively impact a user?
- **Failure Rate**: Number of "hotfixes" required within 48 hours of a release.
- **Contribution to Core**: Number of reusable patterns/modules contributed back to the "Micro-Kernel."
